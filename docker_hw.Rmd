Create a 5 by 10 matrix of random integers
```{r}
x <- matrix(runif(50, 1, 100), ncol=10, nrow=5)
```

Define column names as cond1, cond2, cond3, cond4, cond5, ctrl1, ctrl2, ctrl3, ctrl4, ctrl5
```{r}
colnames(x) <- c("cond1", "cond2", "cond3", "cond4", "cond5", 
                 "ctrl1", "ctrl2", "ctrl3", "ctrl4", "ctrl5")
```

Define row names as gene1, gene2, gene3 ...
```{r}
rownames(x) <- c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3", "gene4", "gene5")
x
```

Compute the fold change for each gene.
```{r}
logfoldchange <- c()
for (i in seq(nrow(x))){
    logfoldchange[i] <- log2(mean(x[i,1:5])/
                                 mean(x[i,6:10]))
}
logfoldchange
```
